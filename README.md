# Learning RL

I am learning about Reinforcement Learning from [this course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html). In this repository, I will implement things as I learn them.

# Included

 * [lecture_2](lecture_2) - use evolution to solve the simple example problem from lecture 2.
 * [lecture_3](lecture_3) - solving two example problems from lecture 3.
 * [lecture_4](lecture_4) - model-free policy evaluation methods
